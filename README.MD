>> <h3> Description </h3>
-------------------------

<p> This project is a big data simulation with creation of DW, ETL and SCHEDULE PROCESSES from ANCINE's public api.
In this project, we captured the data provided by the ANCINE website regarding movie theaters, distributors, co-productions and theater listings.
We perform an ETL in three processes, BRONZE>SILVER>GOLD and in a DW in MYSQL
Performing, in this process, powerful queries that bring results such as expenses per year, distributors per country, listing of rooms per municipality and total profit..</p>
